- The "loading" is simulating a fetch when you scroll down on the main feed
- I was having some trouble with labeling all the interactable buttons for accessability but Im working on it
- The dark mode is definitely a bit rough right now 
    - However I do plan on updating all the colors dark mode included in the future
- Theres a few things and buttons that are left to be fleshed out but its mostly there
- Notifications tab and groups tab sidebar might be deleted since I dont know if I will have time for it
- I would like to implement messaging I think that would be fun but of course Ill do what I have time for
